This is the Default output location for SL Satellite.

Here all the news will be saved with the date. One 
text file for each day. SLS will only record the news
you have selected. 

This is perfect for local viewing oor exporting to
your own app or website.

If you need help with exporting the news to other places
just email me at dangel@indagalaxy.co.uk
