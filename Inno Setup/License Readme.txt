SL Satellite is coded by DAngel of http://www.indagalaxy.co.uk

This project has been in works for a long time, and after a 
few setbacks it is now finished.

With SL Satellite you now have the freedom to do what you want.
You dont have to be on skylords 24/7 just to see if you are being
attacked.

SL Satellite will alert you in a number of ways including...

MSN Style Popup
Transparent Overlay
Sending Emails
Sending SMS*

You can now even be out of the house and still get skylords updates.
You could be at work checking you Email and SL Satellite will send
you an email. You can also recieve SMS messages* providing you set-up
the program and 3rd party site's properly.

*Recieving SMS depends on 3rd party services.
	I send my emails to my email account at orange.co.uk
	When I recieve Emails at Orange they will send me a txt message
	with the email in it. So in other words sign up with your
	mobile provider.

I will constantly be updating SL Satellite, and you comments and 
ideas are welcome. Just PM me ingame "DAngel"...
